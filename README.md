<p>
The first step in this lab will be to create a virtual machine. Make sure that the geographical region is in another location other than your home location.For example I am using (Asia Pacific) Southeast Asia.

<p>
While the Virtual Machine is being created in azure browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ to collect and take note the ip address of your computer. Once the virtual machine is created also browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/ to collect and take note of its ip address and you will notice it is in a different geographical location.

<p>
On your home computer sign up for a free Proton VPN account https://account.protonvpn.com/signup?plan=free&language=en. Back within your VM, download the Proton VPN client. Login to the VPN and choose a VPN server in yet another country (such as Japan)
Browse to https://whatismyipaddress.com/  and take note of this in a text file.

<p>
Try browsing to Google, Disney, and/or Netflix and see if there is anything different about the sites in relation to the location of your VPN server. For example, the language or URL may be different.
